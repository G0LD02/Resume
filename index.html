    <h2>About Me:</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a software engineering student with a tenacious attitude as my Strength. When something needs to be done,
        I take the initiative to get it done because it matters. If I don’t know how to do it, I’ll go the extra mile to learn.
        I’m passionate about achieving great things alongside inspiring people,
        striving for excellence through teamwork and determination. That said, I recognize my journey is just beginning.
        At 20 years old, I value the guidance and knowledge of those around me, as I continue to grow and refine my skills.
